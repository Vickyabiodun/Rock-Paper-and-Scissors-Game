# Rock Paper Scissors
A simple command-line based Rock Paper Scissors game written in Python.

# How to Play
To play the game, run the script in your terminal and follow the prompts. You will be asked to select either 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors. The computer will then make a selection and the winner will be announced.

# Try and Except
The try and except block in this script is used to improve the feedback the app gives in the event of an error. If any errors occur during the execution of the script, the user will be given a message to try again later. This helps to make the app more user-friendly and ensure that it doesn't crash unexpectedly.

# ASCII Art
The game features ASCII art representations of rock, paper, and scissors. These images are sourced from online ASCII art galleries and are stored as string variables in the script.

# Random Module
The random module is imported at the beginning of the script and is used to generate a random selection for the computer's move. This helps to make the game more unpredictable and adds an element of chance to the outcome.
